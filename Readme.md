# 📊 SQL Data Analysis on Superstore Dataset

### **Objective**
Perform data analysis using SQL to derive meaningful insights from the Superstore dataset and document the queries and results.

---

## 📂 **Project Overview**

This project involves:
- Importing a publicly available dataset (Superstore) into a MySQL database.
- Executing various SQL queries to analyze the dataset, such as finding totals, averages, and trends.
- Filtering the dataset based on specific conditions to extract meaningful information.
- Documenting all queries and exporting the results for review.

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench, CLI
- **Dataset**: [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

### **2. SQL Queries**

#### 🔍 **Basic Analysis**
1. Count Total Records
2. Calculate Sum and Average of Sales
3. Find Maximum and Minimum Sales Values

#### 📈 **Insights**
4. Calculate Average Profit by Category
5. Identify Top 5 Products by Total Sales
6. Count Orders by Region

#### 🔍 **Filtering Data**
7. Filter Records Where Profit > 100
8. Filter Records with High Sales (Sales > 500)
9. Filter Records for Specific Region (Region = 'West')
